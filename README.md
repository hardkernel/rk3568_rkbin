# rkbin Repository

The rkbin repository is mainly used to store files that may be used in the early boot stages on Rockchip platforms, including executable binaries, configuration files, tools, and more.

[TOC]

## File Types

Files in the rkbin repository are mainly divided into the following categories:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **binary** | Boot-related binaries such as SPL/DDR/UsbPlug/BL31/BL32/OPTEE, usually built independently from a single repository |
| **mcu** | Binaries usually built jointly from multiple repositories |
| **syscfg** | Global configuration files on MOS platforms |
| **others** | Tools (`tools`), configuration files (`ini`), etc. |


## File Naming

The naming convention for binary files is as follows:

```
[platform]_[component]_[feature]_[version].[postfix]
```

**Naming examples:**

```
bin/rk35/rk3562_spl_v1.07.bin
bin/rk35/rk3562_ddr_1332MHz_D4_LP4_4x_eyescan_v1.09.bin
bin/rk35/rk3528_usbplug_v1.04.bin
bin/rk35/rk3562_bl31_v1.23.elf
bin/rk35/rk3562_bl32_v1.08.bin
```


## Submission Principles

1. **Source-first principle**: Patches in the source repository must be merged first. Then build the target file and submit it to rkbin. Unless there is a special case, submitting temporary or dirty versions to rkbin is prohibited.

   > Dirty version: a version built from local temporary changes that have not yet been committed with git commit.

2. **Traceability principle**: The commit message must be clear enough so that the current version can be **traced** back to the corresponding source repository.

3. **Version management principle**: The binary version must not be lower than v1.00. When updating, you must increment the version number and update the release document.

## Compliance Check

**Pre-submission check**: Run `./scripts/checkpatch.sh`.

> Note: `checkpatch.sh` checks the content of the first commit, so please commit locally before running the script.

## Merge Principle

When there is no -1, at least one review +1 from the patch owner or a reviewer is required before the patch can be merged.


## Commit Message Guidelines

This document defines commit message format requirements for patches of different file types. The goals are:

- Make the current version traceable to the source repository through the commit message
- Unify the commit style
- `Build from...` and `Update features...` are currently mandatory. If you are unsure what to put in `Update features`, it is recommended to use the same content as `Build from`.

> **Note**: This document only defines the basic guideline requirements. To improve traceability, submitters may make reasonable adjustments based on these rules.

## Release Documents

### Content Requirements

When binary files are updated, please update both the Chinese and English documents under `doc/release/` accordingly. Refer to the existing documents for the specific format. Important notes:

- `File`: If multiple files are updated, `{}` can be used as a wildcard expression.

- `Build commit`: The build point in the source repository.

- `Importance`: critical > important > moderate.

  > Chinese version: 紧急 > 重要 > 普通。

- `New`: Use this when new features are updated, and describe them
  item by item in text form. Each item must have a sequence number,
  even if there is only one item.

  For example:

  ```
  1. Add ...
  2. Improve ...
  ```

- `Fixed`: Use this when fixing issues, and describe them item by item in table form.

- `Issue source`: Fill in as needed. It can be a Redmine ID or another textual description. If there is none, fill in `-`.

- Insert a horizontal separator at the end after the update is complete: `------`.

- Run the pre-submission check: `./scripts/checkpatch.sh`.

### **Auto Generation**

In addition to manually adding release document content, you can also modify `scripts/doc-template.txt` as needed, and then run the following command to automatically generate the corresponding content for `doc/release/*.md`.

```shell
./scripts/release-doc.sh -f scripts/doc-template.txt
```

> With this approach, you only need to focus on the document content itself, without worrying about the Markdown document structure or content format.
